Reranker that does [bold](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~taskar/pubs/acl06.pdf) (online)
updates on oracles. Makes use of my little nlp library for ruby, see
[here](https://github.com/pks/zipf).

Usage is straightforward, see the files in the example/ directory:
```
./bold_reranking.rb example/example.ini
```
