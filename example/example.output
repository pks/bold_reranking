Locking device with large Schliesskombinationsanzahl . 
The invention relates to a locking device consisting of a lock and key , which by means of the key in the tractor tumblers , and proposes , in particular for a high number of Schließkombinationen before , that at least one of the tumblers ( 20 ) , in addition to or as an alternative to the direct controlling of the basic code of the corresponding key by means of a magnet coil ( 43 ) in the release position , the at least one supplementary code of the key is a reader ( 44 ) is excited . 
The invention relates to a device consisting of a lock and key , by means of the key in the tractor tumblers . 
This type of locking devices are known . 
They can be , for example , of flat keys which lock cylinder or , however , also be formed with Magnetschlüsseln operating mechanisms . 
All of these closing devices have in common is that the number of Schließkomtinationen often a considerable size which , however , in order to increase the security can be increased even further . 
In particular in view of locking systems with lye and minor keys , there is a need , within a locking system , a large number of keys available which have different access authorizations . 
Frequently , such locking systems have the disadvantage that the key , for all of the locks of the locking system is used , only a relatively simple coding . 
If it is decoupled from the constantly changing users are used ( e.g. in Hotelbetrieb ) , so it is also ensured that the Vorbenutzer not in a simple manner a Schlüsselkopie throughout , it can access into the space occupied by the Nachbenutzer relinquished . 
In many known locking devices , with an increase in the number of the Schließkombinationen also a constructional enlargement of the key , which has a disadvantageous effect on the comfort .
